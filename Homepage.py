Hi, Iâ€™m Louie Abao, a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student at Surigao State University. 
This blog is my space to share the exciting, sometimes overwhelming, and always rewarding journey of navigating technology, innovation, 
and the challenges of being a young engineer.  

Growing up close to nature, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how technology can harmonize with the environment to create sustainable solutions. 
Here, Iâ€™ll share personal stories, projects Iâ€™m working on, and insights on balancing the drive to achieve with the need to stay grounded. 
Letâ€™s learn, innovate, and grow together!

If youâ€™re anything like me, youâ€™ve probably spent countless late nights debugging code, tweaking projects, or researching for that next big idea. 
But somewhere along the way, we forget that rest isnâ€™t just a luxuryâ€”itâ€™s a necessity.  

In this post, Iâ€™m diving into:  
1. The science of why rest makes us better engineers  
2. Practical tips for unplugging when your mind wonâ€™t stop racing  
3. How nature inspired some of my favorite ideas (spoiler: stepping outside works wonders)  

Take it from someone whoâ€™s been there: youâ€™re not slacking off by taking a break. Youâ€™re recharging to come back stronger.
